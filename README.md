# Pratical-RIFE
This project is based on [RIFE](https://github.com/hzwer/arXiv2020-RIFE). This project aims to make RIFE practical for users by adding various features and make this part of work and our academic research independent of each other. This project is developed for engineers and developers. For users, we recommend the following applications:
[Squirrel-RIFE(中文软件)](https://github.com/YiWeiHuang-stack/Squirrel-Video-Frame-Interpolation) | [Waifu2x-Extension-GUI](https://github.com/AaronFeng753/Waifu2x-Extension-GUI) | [Flowframes](https://nmkd.itch.io/flowframes) | [RIFE-ncnn-vulkan](https://github.com/nihui/rife-ncnn-vulkan) | [RIFE-App(Paid)](https://grisk.itch.io/rife-app) | [Autodesk Flame](https://vimeo.com/505942142) | [SVP](https://www.svp-team.com/wiki/RIFE_AI_interpolation) |

# Model training
Since we are in the research stage of engineering tricks, and our work and paper have not been authorized for patents nor published, we are sorry that we cannot provide users with training scripts. If you are interested in our model training, please refer to our academic research project RIFE. 

# To-do List
Multi-frame input of the model

Frame interpolation at any time location

Eliminate artifacts as much as possible

Make the model applicable under any resolution input

Provide models with lower calculation consumption
